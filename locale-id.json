In order to withdraw the bonus itself, you need to achieve a x40 turnover of the bonus amount in the account. If you were given a no deposit bonus, then the leverage is increased to 50, that is, the turnover on the account should be equal to the bonus x50 and the maximum withdrawal amount may not exceed the amount of the no deposit bonus that has been added.
