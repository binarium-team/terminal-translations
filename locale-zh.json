	"faq@c0q1": "How can I start working with Binarium?",

The minimum amount of deposit is 5$/5€/150₴ or 300 rubles. If you are not confident in your abilities, then practice with the demo account and be sure to check out our training materials.</p>",

	"faq@c0a7": "<p>The closing price is the price of the asset at the time the position expires.</p>",
	"faq@c0q8": "Under what conditions does the deal become profitable?",
	"faq@c0a8": "<p>You make a profit in case your forecast came true. For example, you predicted that the price would increase (you've opened a CALL position) - in this case, the profit will be credited to the account if at the moment of the position expiration the asset price will be higher than when the deal was opened.</p>",
	"faq@c0q9": "Can I order a callback from your support service?",
	"faq@c0a9": "<p>Yes. Write a message requesting a call back to the e-mail address <a href=\"mailto:support@binarium.com\">support@binarium.com</a> or write to us in <a class=\"open-chat-button\">online chat</a>. Usually support service staff will get back to you within one business hour.</p>",

	"faq@c2q11": "On what conditions is it possible to withdraw bonus funds?",
	"faq@c2a11": "<p>The bonus itself cannot be withdrawn immediately after it is credited. The broker credits these funds to you as a supplement to your deposit in order to increase your opportunities. Money that is earned using bonus funds is also considered to be part of the bonus and is available for withdrawal only after the required trade volume is reached. In order to withdraw the bonus, you need to achieve a trade volume in the account that is 40 times the amount of the accrued bonus. If you are granted a no deposit bonus, then the leverage increases 50 times, that is, the account trade volume must be equal to 50 times the amount of the bonus. The maximum withdrawal amount cannot exceed the amount of the credited no deposit bonus. Cash prizes that are earned from the company's free tournaments are bonus funds, which are available for withdrawal after making a 40-fold turn.</p><p><strong>Example.</strong> When you replenish your account, you have accrued $150 as a bonus. According to the rules, the total value of open deals must be 40 x 150 = $6,000, after which the bonus funds can be withdrawn. This takes into account both profitable and unprofitable transactions. Transactions that are closed at the opening price are not counted. In addition, please note that the trading platform forbids the use of a double transaction (Martingale) strategy, and transactions that are made using this strategy are not taken into account when working out the bonus, and can also be canceled by the decision of the company. There are no restrictions on the withdrawal of profits.</p><p>If you are going to withdraw part of the deposit, then the bonus will be automatically deducted from your account.</p><p>When determining a bonus, an amount not exceeding 5% of the amount of actively received bonuses is taken into account when considering how much of a single transaction is counted towards the trading volume. For example, if you received a bonus of USD 100, then up to USD 5 per transaction is taken into account for determining the bonus. If you open a transaction for USD 20, then USD 5 will be calculated as part of the trading volume.</p> <p>Any points that remain unclear can be clarified by the Binarium support service.</p>",
	"faq@c2q12": "What is a risk-free deal?",
	"faq@c2a12": "<p>When you top up using special promotional codes or offers, your account will be credited with a certain number of transactions, which you can open without risking your deposit (the number and amount of transactions are specified in the description of the offer or promotional code). </p><p>When you open a risk-free deal, funds are not deducted from your balance, all the profit is credited to your account as a bonus. </p><p> When you receive risk-free deals, your balance is debited for the amount equal to the total amount of deals and credited to your account as a bonus. For example, you added $100 to your account and received 3 risk-free deals for the amount of $10 each. In this case, $30 is debited from your actual balance and credited to your account as a bonus.</p><p>Terms for claiming bonuses for risk-free deals are similar to the terms applied to regular bonuses.<p>",

If you think that the price will fall, click on the red button with the downward pointing arrow.<br>Please note that the Binarium platform prohibits any systematic use of a Martingale strategy for doubling transactions. Violation of this rule may lead to the cancellation of transactions and the freezing of your trading account.</p>",

It contains the exact price of the asset at the time of closing and opening the transaction, the name of the asset, the opening/closing time of the transaction to within a second.</p><p>If the trader has any doubts, the broker will send a request to the quotation provider regarding the reconciliation of quotations. In this case, the verification process lasts no less than 3 days from the date of the application. The client receives the verification results immediately after they are received by the Binarium.</p>",
	"faq@c3q10": "Why quotes do not coincide with FOREX-quotations and other sources?",
	"faq@c3a10": "<p>The reasons for such variance are:</p><ul><li>Forex displays the price of Bid and Ask, while Binarium displays the average price, which is calculated by the formula (Bid+Ask)/2;</li><li>Quotations come from different sources, they may vary slightly;</li><li>A small difference in the time of receipt of quotations may cause a difference in quotes (exactly - 4th-5th digit after comma).</li></ul><p>By registering you agree that it is the quotes from Binarium that are of primary importance. They may not coincide with quotations from other resources. Third-party resources can not be used to reconcile quotations, they can be used only as an auxiliary tool.</p>",
