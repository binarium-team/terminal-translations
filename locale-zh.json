When important news comes out, previously reliable indicators and trading systems happen to generate false signals. This is no surprise, because a fundamental factor may bring great volatility to the market.</p><p>This is the reason why experienced traders prefer to pause when important news is about to come out. This explains low activity on the markets when charts display prices in a sideways trend. However, this makes it possible to determine the price channel. Upon the release of news, a movement occurs and once the price channel is broken, you should immediately enter into a transaction in the strike direction.</p><p>The example shows that a news release brought a lot of buyers to the market which resulted in a broken price channel. This means you should buy a <strong>CALL</strong> option: </p><img src='/assets/strategy/news-3-en.jpg'><p>Remember that a plummeting  exchange rate resulting from the news does not last forever: usually the rate gradually reverts to the level it was at before the information was released. Therefore, if you did not manage to open a relevant type of the transaction immediately after the release of the news, it is better not to risk trying to catch the trend going away. You might want to pause and resume trading in a couple of hours when the market digests the news and regains its stability.</p><h2>Trading recommendations</h2><ul><li>Expiration: <strong>15-30 minutes</strong></li><li>Investment: <strong>2% of your deposit</strong></li></ul>",

The strategy of trading on market corrections is a basic tool, and it should be mastered by every trader.</p><h2>Why should you use this strategy?</h2><p>Financial markets are in constant flux: the prices for assets can both skyrocket and collapse. However, the market equilibrium will sooner or later lead to a correction of the value of assets, moving it back into the direct trading band.</p><h2>How can you trade on market corrections?</h2><p>Prices are fluid. If a price rises, then it can fall again. This is the basis of financial markets. Certain price movements are repeated, and a market correction is just one such movement.</p><img src='/assets/strategy/corr-1.jpg'><p>It is important to take into account that when an asset is on an upward trend, it should not have any local maxima. Similarly, if it is on a downward trend, there should not be any local minima.</p><p>First we should establish the trend. For example, on the candlestick chart we can see an emerging upward trend. We discover a very long candle, after which we can expect an inflection point in the price. This when we open a trade with a short position. We advise you to wait for the moment when it becomes clear that such a turning point will take place. A couple of candles against the trend can tell us this, signaling that a correction is about to take place.</p><img src='/assets/strategy/corr-2.jpg'><h2>Trading recommendations</h2><ul><li>Expiration: <strong>2–4 candles</strong></li><li>Investment: <strong>4% of the deposit amount</strong></li></ul>",

	"st@pinocchio-text": "<h1>Pinocchio Strategy</h1><p>The Pinocchio strategy has gained its name from pin bar candles looking just like the head of the fairy-tale character. The body of the candle stands for the head while the shadow is very similar to Pinocchio’s nose.</p><p>When you discover such a candle on your chart, a trend change is about to take place. The longer the nose gets, the more likely it is that changes will occur on the chart. The Pinocchio strategy stands out with its simplicity and efficiency. </p><h2>Why Choose This Particular Strategy?</h2><p>The Pinocchio strategy is popular with a wide range of traders, ranging from newcomers to professionals. Clear and simple to use, the strategy is based on frequent signals occurring on the chart and offering a high probability of success. To use this particular strategy in trading, you need a candlestick chart. The aim of the strategy is to look for pin bar candles, or Pinocchios as called by traders.</p><h2>How the Pinocchio Strategy is Used in Trading?</h2><p>First of all, make sure you activate the candlestick chart view. You can do this by choosing the relevant option in the menu bar:</p><img src='/assets/img/strategy/pinocchio-1-en.jpg'><p>As for the example, the model by the Pinocchio strategy involves three candles. The signal comes when a local maximum or a local minimum is hit, signalling a trend change. In this case, the shadow of the candle represents Pinocchio’s nose. The higher it is, the more likely the trend change will occur since the price does not correspond to the trend at this particular moment.</p><img src='/assets/img/strategy/pinocchio-2-en.jpg'><h2>Trading recomendations</h2><ul><li>Expiration: <strong>15-30 minutes</strong></li><li>Investment: <strong>2% от of your deposit</strong></li></ul>",
	"st@fibonacci-text": "<h1>Fibonacci Retracement Strategy</h1><p>Many traders of binary options successfully use levels in their trading. Levels make it possible to apply technical indicators very effectively. One of the most effective indicators is Fibonacci retracement.</p><h2>When should I use this strategy?</h2><p>Everyone knows that Fibonacci strategies should only be used in markets with obvious trends. By contrast, a Fibonacci series is totally unsuitable for flat trading.</p><h2>How do you trade using a Fibonacci retracement strategy?</h2><p>First of all, you need to correctly determine the levels. An upward trend involves tracing a line from the lowest point to the highest one. The opposite is true when tracing a downward trend.</p><p>Let's add the indicator to the chart.</p><img src='/assets/strategy/fibo-1.jpg'><p>Let's determine the minimum and maximum prices for the next period.</p><img src='/assets/strategy/fibo-2.jpg'><p>Having established the direction, we obtain 6 levels with a starting point of 100 and an ending point of 0. By default, the levels are established at the following points: 23.6 (0.236), 38.2 (0.382), 50 (0.5), and 61.8 (0.618). These numbers describe a Fibonacci series. The indicator settings allow you to add new levels and delete old ones. But this should only be done by traders who are experienced and have advanced technical skills. We do not recommend that novices change the standard values.</p><p>It is generally accepted that a market correction can occur up to the levels of 38%, 50%, and 62%</p><img src='/assets/strategy/fibo-3.jpg'><p>Here is our main piece of advice when using this strategy: do not blindly trust the levels that the indicator demonstrates. False signals should be filtered by applying additional instruments.</p><h2>Trading recommendations</h2><ul><li>Expiration: <strong>1–2 candles</strong></li><li>Investment: <strong>2% of the deposit amount</strong></li></ul>",
